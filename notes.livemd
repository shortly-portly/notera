# Notera

## Introduction

Notera is a note taking app combined with an action log. It is my attempt to mix the best bits of One Note with TODO and a sprinkling of GTD.

There are four main entities with the system:

* Notes
* Projects
* Tasks
* People

A note can be associated with a combination of Project, Task or Person (or none).
